abspath.lzh         - Archive containing a file with an absolute path.  For
                      security reasons, file extraction should always be done
                      relative to the extraction path.  If extraction to
                      absolute paths was permitted, it would potentially allow
                      arbitrary files on the filesystem to be overwritten.

badterm.lzh         - Archive containing a file that includes an unsafe
                      terminal escape sequence (changes the title in the
                      terminal window). This terminal escape sequence should
                      not appear in list output.

dir.lzh             - Archive that just contains a directory.

multiple.lzh        - Archive containing multiple stored files with different
                      names, for testing wildcard pattern matching.

truncated.lzh       - Unexpectedly truncated -lh5- archive.

unixsep.lzh         - Archive containing a level 0 header where the filename
                      has a path separated with Unix-style path separators
                      ('/') instead of DOS-style ('\'). This file is manually
                      constructed, but archives like this do exist in the wild.
