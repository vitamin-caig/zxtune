============

https://github.com/libsidplayfp/libsidplayfp

libsidplayfp is a C64 music player library which integrates
the reSID SID chip emulation into a cycle-based emulator
environment, constantly aiming to improve emulation of the
C64 system and the SID chips.

* Build

This package uses autotools so the usual ./configure && make is enough to build
the libraries. If cloning the bare sources the package need to be bootstrapped
in advance with the autoreconf -i command. This step requires the xa cross-assembler
to compile the 6502 code, usually provided by distributions with the xa65 package
or available at http://www.floodgap.com/retrotech/xa/.

In addition to the standard build options the following are available:

--enable-debug[=no/yes/full]
compile with debugging messages
disabled by default

--enable-inline
enable inlinig in reSID engine, increases performances at the expense of bigger code size
enabled by default

--enable-branch-hints
enable branch hints in reSID engine so the compiler can produce more optimized code
enabled by default

--with-simd=<sse2/mmx/neon/none>
enable SIMD code in reSIDfp that might increase resampling performance.
Be aware that this is processor specific and the compiler could actually produce
more optimized code with the appropriate flags. Use only if you know what you're doing.
none by default

--enable-testsuite=PATH_TO_TESTSUITE
add support for running VICE testsuite (in prg format). The testsuite is available
in the repository. Intended only for regression tests since it may break normal
code execution. The path to testsuite must include terminal path separator
disabled by default

--enable-tests
enables unit tests. Requires libUnitTest++ installed. Use "make check" to launch the testsuite
disabled by default

--enable-hardsid
enables hardsid support

--with-gcrypt / --without-gcrypt
force/disable libgcrypt support for MD5 computation
default check

--with-exsid
Build with exsid support. Requires either libexsid or one of libfdti1 or libftd2xx

--disable-openmp
do not use OpenMP


If doxygen is installed and detected by the configure script the documentation
can be built by invoking "make doc".



Known bugs/limitations:
* mus data embedded in psid file is not supported
* hardsid support is untested and possibly broken
